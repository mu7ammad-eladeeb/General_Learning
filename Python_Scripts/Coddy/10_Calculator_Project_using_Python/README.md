# **The basics**

Let's start with the calculation!


# **Challenge**

Easy

Create function `calc` which gets operator and two numbers and returns the calculation result.

Examples:

`calc('+', 1, 3)` -> `4`

`calc('*', 2, 3)` -> `6`

`calc('/', 1, 4)` -> `0.25`

`calc('-', 1, 3)` -> `-2`

For now, deal only with the basic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.

> *The return value can be float and not only int!*

# Solution

```python
def calc(operator, num1, num2):
    if operator == '+':
        return num1 + num2
    elif operator == '-':
        return num1 - num2
    elif operator == '*':
        return num1 * num2
    elif operator == '/':
        return num1 / num2
```

# Explanation

The `calc` function takes three arguments:

```python
def calc(operator, num1, num2):
```

- `operator` stores the mathematical operator, such as `+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`.
- `num1` is the first number.
- `num2` is the second number.

We then use `if` and `elif` statements to check which operator was provided.

For addition:

```python
if operator == '+':
    return num1 + num2
```

If the operator is `+`, the function adds the two numbers and returns the result.

For subtraction:

```python
elif operator == '-':
    return num1 - num2
```

If the operator is `-`, the function subtracts the second number from the first.

For multiplication:

```python
elif operator == '*':
    return num1 * num2
```

If the operator is `*`, the function multiplies the two numbers.

For division:

```python
elif operator == '/':
    return num1 / num2
```

If the operator is `/`, the function divides the first number by the second.

The `/` operator can produce a `float`, which is why the result can be a decimal value, as required by the challenge.

For example:

```python
calc('+', 1, 3)  # 4
calc('*', 2, 3)  # 6
calc('/', 1, 4)  # 0.25
calc('-', 1, 3)  # -2
```

The important idea is to use the value of `operator` to decide which calculation should be performed, then `return` the corresponding result.
